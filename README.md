## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: macOS Permissions

The MacSSH application requires special permissions to execute external commands (ssh, sftp, scp). The application automatically checks and requests necessary permissions.

**Required permissions:**
1. **Full Disk Access** - required for executing SSH commands
2. **Accessibility** - for automation (optional)

**Automatic setup:**
- The application automatically checks permissions on startup
- You can see the status of all permissions in SSH Tools Manager
- The "Request Full Disk Access" button automatically opens System Settings
- Detailed instructions are available in SSH Tools Manager

**Manual setup:**
If automatic setup doesn't work, follow the instructions in the [PERMISSIONS_FIX.md](PERMISSIONS_FIX.md) file.
