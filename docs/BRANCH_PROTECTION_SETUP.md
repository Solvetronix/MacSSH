# üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to configure branch protection rules for the automatic deployment system. Proper branch protection ensures that only reviewed and tested code can trigger automatic deployments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### 1. Main Branch Protection
**üö® ALWAYS protect the main branch!**

The main branch is the production branch that triggers automatic deployments. It must be protected to prevent unauthorized releases.

### 2. Development Workflow
**üö® ALWAYS work in development branch!**

All development should happen in the `development` branch, with changes merged to `main` only after review.

### 3. Pull Request Requirements
**üö® ALWAYS require pull requests for main branch!**

Direct pushes to main should be disabled to ensure proper code review.

## üîß Branch Setup

### 1. Create Development Branch

#### Step 1: Create and Push Development Branch
```bash
# Create development branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b development

# Push development branch to remote
git push -u origin development
```

#### Step 2: Set Development as Default (Optional)
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under **Default branch**, select **development**
3. Click **Update**
4. Confirm the change

### 2. Configure Branch Protection

#### Step 1: Access Branch Protection
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** or **Add branch protection rule**

#### Step 2: Configure Main Branch Protection
```
Branch name pattern: main

Protect matching branches:
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require approvals: 1 (or more as needed)
‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
‚úÖ Require review from code owners
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
‚úÖ Require signed commits
‚úÖ Require linear history
‚úÖ Require deployments to succeed before merging

Restrict pushes that create files that are larger than: 100 MB
‚úÖ Allow force pushes
‚úÖ Allow deletions
```

#### Step 3: Configure Development Branch Protection (Optional)
```
Branch name pattern: development

Protect matching branches:
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging

‚úÖ Allow force pushes
‚úÖ Allow deletions
```

## üìã Branch Protection Checklist

### Main Branch Protection
- [ ] Require pull request before merging
- [ ] Require at least 1 approval
- [ ] Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
- [ ] Require review from code owners
- [ ] Require status checks to pass
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date
- [ ] Require conversation resolution
- [ ] Require signed commits
- [ ] Require linear history
- [ ] Require deployments to succeed

### Development Branch Protection
- [ ] Require pull request before merging
- [ ] Require at least 1 approval
- [ ] Require status checks to pass
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date

### General Settings
- [ ] Restrict file size uploads
- [ ] Configure force push permissions
- [ ] Configure deletion permissions

## üîÑ Workflow Configuration

### 1. Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Make changes
# ... code changes ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"

# Push to development
git push origin development
```

### 2. Release Workflow
```bash
# Create pull request from development to main
# OR merge directly (if allowed)

# The system will automatically:
# 1. Trigger deployment workflow
# 2. Increment version
# 3. Build application
# 4. Create GitHub release
# 5. Update appcast.xml
```

### 3. Emergency Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# For critical fixes, create hotfix branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make minimal changes
# ... critical fix ...

# Create pull request to main
# This bypasses development branch for urgent fixes
```

## üö® Security Considerations

### 1. Code Owner Configuration
Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` file:
```
# Global code owners
* @your-username @team-lead

# Specific file owners
/docs/ @documentation-team
/.github/workflows/ @devops-team
```

### 2. Required Status Checks
Configure required status checks in branch protection:
- `build` - Build verification
- `test` - Test suite execution
- `lint` - Code quality checks
- `security` - Security scanning

### 3. Signed Commits
Enable signed commits for security:
```bash
# Configure GPG signing
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

## üîç Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. Branch Protection Alerts
- Monitor failed status checks
- Track pull request reviews
- Alert on direct pushes to main
- Monitor deployment failures

### 2. Workflow Monitoring
- Track deployment success rates
- Monitor build times
- Alert on failed releases
- Track version increments

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Track certificate usage
- Alert on security vulnerabilities
- Monitor dependency updates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Branch Protection Too Restrictive
```bash
# Temporarily disable protection for emergency
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
# Uncheck required checks temporarily
# Re-enable after emergency fix
```

#### 2. Status Checks Not Running
- Verify workflow file location
- Check workflow trigger conditions
- Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled
- Verify repository permissions

#### 3. Pull Request Not Merging
- Check approval requirements
- Verify status checks pass
- Ensure branch is up to date
- Check conversation resolution

#### 4. Force Push Blocked
- Use pull request instead
- Request admin override
- Create new branch from main
- Rebase development branch

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always use pull requests** for main branch changes
2. **Require code reviews** for all changes
3. **Use conventional commits** for automatic release notes
4. **Test in development** before merging to main
5. **Monitor deployment logs** for issues
6. **Keep branches up to date** regularly
7. **Use feature branches** for complex changes
8. **Document emergency procedures** for critical fixes

## üîÑ Emergency Procedures

### Critical Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Make minimal required changes
3. Create pull request to main
4. Request expedited review
5. Merge and deploy
6. Cherry-pick to development

### Rollback Process
1. Revert merge commit
2. Force push to main
3. Delete problematic release
4. Update appcast.xml
5. Notify team of rollback

**Note**: Proper branch protection is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing unauthorized deployments. Always test the workflow in a development environment first.
